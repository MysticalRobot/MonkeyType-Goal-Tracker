- use browsers local storage to store daily typing time and current goal
- if goal or username change, check the local storage to see if the user still has a streak (only possible if the user has typed at least as much daily as their new goal)
- store the longest streak with the goal time spent typing
- notify when daily goal has been reached
- store current streak

- background script: 
    - browser apis: sidebarAction, storage, action, alarms, theme, runtime
    - listeners must be registered synchronously and be at the top of the script
    - no global variables; use storage api to manage state
    - use alarms instead of setTimeout()
    - when extension is installed, open the popup to get the user to enter their typing goals (duration and frequency (day/week/month/year)) into the popup. 
    - limit total monkeytype api requests to 30. get test activity for the last 372 days and grab as many results as possible. compute the time spent typing for each day, store it, and then compute the longest streak that satisfies the users goal. if the streak has yet to end, keep it as the current one as well. store the data for the last day separately but throw it into the pile with the rest of the data at midnight (via alarm). send computation back to the popup to display. 
- popup script
    - whenever form data is changed, store it or just send it to the background script to recompute the longest streak. 
    - skeleton ui while waiting for background script streak computation
    - display historical best streak and current streak with goal. 
- content script
    - when a test completes, add the time spent typing to the browser storage 
    - keep the browser action icon's colors in sync with the user's theme
